# SmartVote
This app allows you to select one of six "consensus steps", which are shown in specific colors with explainations. You can use this to show your position with your smartphone instead a card of paper or it can help you to remember the six steps. This functionality is for demonstration purpose only. Its not yet very useful in practice. 

The planed SmartModeration apps will be based on peer to peer communication between the smartphones of a group of people.
